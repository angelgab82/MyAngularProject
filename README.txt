AngularJS: Get Started:

This demo demonstrates how to use the essential abstractions of AngularJS,
including modules, controllers, directives, and services.
This application is using github open rest services: https://api.github.com/

In the application client will be able to browse users from github,
and would be able to see there photo and search for new users.

In user details you will be able to view the issues with each repository and who commented on it.

- The project starts from index.html
- Controllers are located under /js/controllers/
- Services are located under /js/services/
- The html templates is in folder /view/
- Library /js/lib/

Files detail:
- app.js is the application router
- index.html (this page has the default template)

Gabriel
